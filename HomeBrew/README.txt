NOTE
	
	This file has not been tested YET because I already have HomeBrew installed by 3 today I will have tested it.
	
	This file is made for Python 2.7 and Ruby, all langs that OSX has preinstalled, so this is 100% made for Mac.

Setup:
	
	First you must have access to the terminal, if you don’t have that…download hyper.app at http://hyper.is, its a 	terminal but a lot more pretty

	Second, drag the HomeBrew folder to the desktop, it may not work if you dont.

Installation:

	To install go to terminal and type:    cd ~/Desktop
	Then type:    python getHomeBrew.py
	Then type what you need to in the GUI I made,
	Then let it do the rest.
	Keep the terminal open if you wish to view the progress

Usage:

	Once you have installed type brew search, then the software you want
	Or brew install if you know the name of the software,
	Congrats!!! You have installed HomeBrew without root
